# StringCalculatorDemo

This Java based String Calculator follows Test Driven Development Approach (TDD)

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice enabling developers to create proper specifications about how their code should be written and implemented. Fundamentally, TDD is a practice when a programmer writes a functional test before building a code.

It follows 3 stages :
1. Red
2. Green and 
3. Refactor 

is the three phase of Test Driven Development and this the sequence that get followed while writing code

TDD has the following steps:

Think & write test cases
Red – Failure of test case
Green – Code and get the new test case pass
Green – Ensure all old test cases also pass
Refactor the code to clean it
Repeat this cycle


In this Github Repository basic Continous Integration (Ci)Pipeline is implemented for three different jobs i.e. 
1. Super linter: to check bugs and syntaxes errors in Java code

2. Java with maven: to check maven build 

3. Github Actons Build: to check mandatory build of  the code.


Also along with Ci, another third-party integration is done for checking Code Quality using Codefactor.io which automatically and continuously tracks code quality with every GitHub or BitBucket commit and pull request, helping software developers save time in code reviews and efficiently tackle technical debt. CodeFactor.io is a tool in the Code Review category of a tech stack.
